Java Variables, Types, Expressions and User Input

## What to know
Before you begin this project, you need to be familiar with Java variables, data types, Strings, arithmetic expressions and reading user input.  
  
If you are not familiar with this already, watch the following tutorial within the given time frame:  
- [Types](https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?t=1552) [25:22] to [End of Reading Input](https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?t=5140) [1:30:43]  
  
It is highly recommended to type and run the code along with the video on any IDE or using an online compiler such as [online-java.com](https://www.online-java.com/online_java_compiler).

Hint: You can use the Math.pow() function by importing the Math module, by adding ``import java.util.*`` line at the beginning of your file.  

## Instructions
