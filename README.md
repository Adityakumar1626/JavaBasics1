# JavaBasics1
Java Variables, Types, Expressions and User Input

## What to know
Before you begin this project, you need to be familiar with Java variables, data types, Strings, arithmetic expressions and reading user input.  
  
If you are not familiar with this already, watch the following tutorial within the given time frame:  
- [Types](https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?t=1552) [25:22] to [End of Reading Input](https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?t=5140) [1:30:43]  
  
It is highly recommended to type and run the code along with the video on any IDE or using an online compiler such as [online-java.com](https://www.online-java.com/online_java_compiler).  
  
# The Project - BMI Calculator
Write a program that asks the user for their name, height and weight and returns their BMI (Body Mass Index).  

Body Mass Index formula:

Hint: You can use the Math.pow() function by importing the Math module, by adding ``import java.util.*`` line at the beginning of your file.  

## Instructions 
- Copy the code from the project file [BMICalculator.java](https://github.com/Github-Amity/JavaBasics1/blob/main/BMICalculator.java) and paste it in an online java compiler. Change the class name and its references to "Main" to match the file name of the online compiler.  Watch [this](https://youtu.be/xgyo7UsfKZo) tutorial if you're using an online compiler for the project.  
Instead, if you have a code editor and Java installed on your system, download the code (ZIP file). Watch [this](https://screenrec.com/share/oM6FZ9VsIW) to learn how to do that.  
Instead, if you have git installed, you can [clone the repository](https://screenrec.com/share/mYGUsDTH9F).
- There are three blocks of code you need to add. The instructions for the code you need to write are given with üî¥ emoji and the areas are marked with ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è emojis. Do NOT write anything outside these areas.
- Once you are done, run the code in your editor and make sure that your method is correct and your input and output match the ones given below.

- If you used an online compiler, simply create a new file, add your filename (eg: SalmaBMICalculator.java) and open a pull request.  
- Otherwise, if you used an IDE, before submitting, change the name of the file to include your name.  
For example:  
If your name is Salma, change the name of the file to SalmaBMICalculator.java  
- Similarly, change the name of your class (and all its references) to include your name (otherwise, the code will not run in your IDE).  
- The create a fork of this repository, submit your file and open a pull request. Watch [this](https://screenrec.com/share/FmnKtd61DW) to learn how to do that.


Congratulations on completing the project!
