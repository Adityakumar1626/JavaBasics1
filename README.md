# JavaBasics1
Java Variables, Types, Expressions and User Input

## What to know
Before you begin this project, you need to be familiar with Java variables, data types, Strings, arithmetic expressions and reading user input.  
  
If you are not familiar with this already, watch the following tutorial within the given time frame:  
- [Types](https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?t=1552) [25:22] to [End of Reading Input](https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?t=5140) [1:30:43]  
  
It is highly recommended to type and run the code along with the video on any IDE or using an online compiler such as [online-java.com](https://www.online-java.com/online_java_compiler).  
  
# The Project - BMI Calculator
Write a program that asks the user for their name, height and weight and returns their BMI (Body Mass Index).  

Body Mass Index formula:

Hint: You can use the Math.pow() function by importing the Math module, by adding ``import java.util.*`` line at the beginning of your file.  

## Instructions
- Clone the repository to obtain the project file [BMICalculator.java](https://github.com/Github-Amity/JavaBasics1/blob/main/BMICalculator.java). Watch [this](https://screenrec.com/share/mYGUsDTH9F) to learn how to clone a repository.
- There are three blocks of code you need to add. The instructions for the code you need to write are given with üî¥ emoji and the areas are marked with ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è emojis. Do NOT write anything outside these areas.
- Once you are done, run the code in your editor and make sure that your method is correct and your input and output match the ones given below.

- Before submitting, change the name of the class to include your name.  
For example:  
If your name is Salma, change the name of the class to SalmaBMICalculator.  

- Similarly, change the name of your file to include your name (otherwise, the code will not run in your IDE).  
- Create a fork of this repository, submit your file and open a pull request. Watch [this](https://screenrec.com/share/FmnKtd61DW) to learn how to do that.


Congratulations on completing the project!
